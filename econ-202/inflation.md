# Inflation
**inflation** - overall rise in prices

**headling inflation** - inflation for all goods

**core inflation** - inflation for all goods (except food and oil)

**deflation** - negative inflation

**disinflation** - less positive inflation

**neutrality of money** - real output is independent of the money supply

**classical theory of inflation** - In long run, increase in money supply leads to increase in prices only

# Causes of inflation

## 1. Quantity theory of money

<details> 
<summary>

$M * V = P * Y$

</summary>

* $M$ - money supply
* $V$ - velocity of money is how many times money is used in a year (usually constant)
* $P$ - price level
* $Y$ - real GDP
* If $M$ increases ⬆, $P$ increases ⬆ and vice versa

</details>

<details>
<summary>

$\%\Delta M = \%\Delta P + \%\Delta Y$

</summary>

* $\%\Delta M + \%\Delta V = \%\Delta P + \%\Delta Y$
* assuming $V$ is constant
* $ \therefore\%\Delta V = 0$   
* if $M > Y$ ⮕ inflation
* if $M < Y$ ⮕ deflation
* if $M = Y$ ⮕ no change in price level

</details>

In the long run, inflation results from the money supply increasing faster than real GDP

## 2. Demand-pull inflation
* When economy is in a boom, demand for goods and services increases
* AD shifts right ⮕, prices increase ⬆

## 3. Cost-push inflation
* When cost of production increases, firms increase prices to cover costs
* SRAS shifts left ⬅, prices increase ⬆

## Real interest rate = nominal interest rate - inflation rate

</summary>

* If inflation rate is higher than nominal interest rate, real interest rate is negative
* If inflation rate is lower than nominal interest rate, real interest rate is positive
* If inflation rate is 0, real interest rate is equal to nominal interest rate

# Why do we care about inflation?
* quantity theory doesn't always hold
* costs of inflation

# Costs of inflation

## Predictable inflation:
1. Menu costs
    * money, time, and opportunity costs of changing prices
2. Shoe-leather costs
    * money, time, and oppurtunity costs of managing cash
3. Tax distortions
    * taxes are not indexed to inflation
    * decreases purchasing power of money

## Unpredictable inflation:
1. Confusion costs
    * firms and individuals have a hard time planning for the future
2. Wealth redistribution between savers and borrowers
    * saves lose wealth, borrowers gain wealth
    * when inflation is very low, the opposite is true
    * if inflation is predictable, interest rates can be adjusted to compensate for inflation and savers and borrowers are not affected

## Student loans
* Student loans are not indexed to inflation
* If inflation is higher than expected, student loans become more cheaper to pay off
* If inflation is lower than expected, student loans become more expensive to pay off
* There is only wealth redistribution between borrowers and lenders if inflation is higher than expected

# Hyperinflation

## Inflate away the debt
* inflation reduces the real value of debt
* increase in money supply cause inflation
* government can inflate away the debt
* works if done modestly, but if done too much, it can cause hyperinflation

* if inflation remains high, that will get baked into the price level and the economy will be stuck in a high inflation environment
* very difficult to get out of hyperinflation

## Controlling inflation - disinflation
* contractionary monetary policy
* decrease in money supply
* decrease in AD
* decrease in inflation
* painful in the short run, but necessary in the long run


# Problems with Deflation

1. Burden of debt
    * debt becomes more expensive to pay off
    * defaults on debt increase

2. Investment
    * firms are less likely to invest in new projects

3. Consumption
    * consumers postpone purchases

## Deflationary spiral
* when prices are falling, consumers postpone purchases
* firms postpone investment
* firms lay off workers
* workers have less money to spend, AD shifts left ⬅
* prices fall even more, deflationary spiral

# Why little inflation is good?
1. Buffer against the risk of deflation
2. Expansionary Monetary Policy
3. Easier for firms to adjust real wages


# Conclusion
1. modest and predictable inflation is good
2. high, unpredictable inflation and deflation are bad

### Is government debt good or bad?
| benefits | costs |
| -------- | -------- |
| flexible during bad times | direct costs = interest rate on borrowing |
| investments => economic growth and properity | indirect costs = crowding out |
| | can limit options in long run |

people today benefits but future generation pays for the loan

# Money creation
## Fractional reserve banking
* Banks only keep a fraction of their deposits in reserve
* Banks can lend out the rest of the deposits and create extra money
* For simplicity, Money = Currency + Checking Deposits

### What determines the amount of money in the economy?
1. The Federal Reserve
2. Banks
3. Firms
4. Households

### What does money creation depend on?
<details>
<summary>

Reserves = Required Reserves + Excess Reserves

</summary>

* Reserves = Total amount of money that banks hold in reserve
* Required Reserves = Fraction of deposits that banks must keep in reserve
* Excess Reserves = Deposits - Required Reserves
* A bank can decide to keep more money in reserve than required
* Required reserve ratio ($R$) is the fraction of deposits that banks must keep in reserve due to law (set by the Feds)

</details>

Money multiplier = $1 \over R$

$\Delta$ Checking account balances = $\Delta$ Excess reserves $\times$ $1 \over R$

### Why is real world multiplier is much smaller than the money multiplier?
* We assumed that banks lend out all excess reserves
* We assumed that entire loan is deposited back into the bank
* Foreigners often hold currency
* Also, depends on bank's willingness to lend

If, 

Excess reserves increase ⬆ = Loans increase ⬆  = Money supply increase ⬆
and if, 

Excess reserves decrease ⬇ = Loans decrease ⬇  = Money supply decrease ⬇


### M1 vs M2
Monetary base = Currency + Reserves
| M1 | M2 |
| --- | --- |
| Currency + Checking Deposits | M1 + Savings accounts + other assets |

## Why do we need central banks (Feds)?
1. Manage money supply
    * Control inflation
2. Act as lender of last resort
    * Positive - Prevents bank runs
    * Negative - Moral hazard

# The Federal Reserve
## Organization of the Federal Reserve
1. 12 District Federal Reserve Banks
    * research, check clearing, and other services in their region
2. 7 Board of Governors
    * appointed by the president for 14 year non-renewable terms
    * 1 of 7 is the chairperson
3. FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee)
    * 5 district bank presidents (NY always included) + 7 board of governors
    * meets 8 times a year
    * decides on interest rate and money supply


## Dual mandate
1. Promote economic growth and full employment 
    * natural rate of unemployment
2. Maintain price stability
    * control inflation

## How does the Fed control the money supply?
1. Open market operations
    * buying and selling government bonds
    * buying bonds increases money supply
    * selling bonds decreases money supply
2. Discount rate
    * interest rate that the Fed charges banks for loans
    * higher interest rate decreases money supply
    * lower interest rate increases money supply
3. Reserve requirement ratio
    * fraction of deposits that banks must keep in reserve
    * higher reserve requirement decreases money supply
    * lower reserve requirement increases money supply

Feds Buying bonds ⬆ = Bank's excess reserves ⬆ = Federal Funds Rate ⬇ = Interest rates ⬇ = Money supply ⬆ = AD shifts right ⮕ = Inflation ⬆ = Output ⬆ = Employment ⬆

Feds Selling bonds ⬇ = Bank's excess reserves ⬇ = Federal Funds Rate ⬆ = Interest rates ⬆ = Money supply ⬇ = AD shifts left ⬅ = Inflation ⬇ = Output ⬇ = Employment ⬇

## Contractionary monetary policy vs Expansionary monetary policy
| Contractionary monetary policy | Expansionary monetary policy |
| --- | --- |
| Decrease money supply | Increase money supply |
| Shifts AD curve to the left | Shifts AD curve to the right |
| Implemented during expansionary phase | Implemented during recessionary phase |
| Controls inflation | Boosts Employment |

## Challenges vs Advantages of monetary policy
| Challenges | Advantages |
| --- | --- |
| Time lags and imperfect information | Doesn't have to wait for politicians |
| | Fed is made up of prominent economic policymakers |
